## 🔍 Objective

Mirrors can mislead AI vision systems—particularly in robotics or drone navigation—by presenting reflections as real objects or paths. This model helps to **detect and identify mirrors in real-time video streams or images**, enabling smarter, safer decision-making.

## 📁 Dataset - MSD

This project uses a custom dataset called **MSD** (Mirror Surface Dataset).

### Dataset Format

- **YOLOv8 Format**
  - Each image has a corresponding `.txt` file with labels in YOLO format.
  - Label format:  
    `class_id center_x center_y width height` (all normalized values)

### Data Configuration (`data.yaml`)

```yaml
path: MSD/training                # Root directory for training data
train: MSD/train/images                    # Folder with training images
test: MSD/test/images                  # Folder with validation images

nc: 1                             # Number of classes
names: ['mirror']                 # Class name
```
